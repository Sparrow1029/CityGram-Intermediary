# Voting Centers Resources

Code, data, and resources for building the source file for Orlando voting notifications

## Getting Started

This sub-project uses a Python command line utility to process raw data files. You'll need Python3 installed (preferably always the most recent minor version). You should activate a virtual env, but it's not the end of the world. Install the dependacies:

```python
cd voting_centers
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The command line utility has built-in help docs and is callable like so:

```bash
python factory.py -h
```
